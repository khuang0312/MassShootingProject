Stack
----------------
We'll be using Typescript for this project. Make sure to compile your code with the TS compiler

Front-end
React 
Tailwind CSS - seems interesting, may not be necessary
Sass - ditto (i'd recommend trying to explore this one though)
GraphQL - We'll keep this as this will allow the frontend to more efficiently make requests

Feel free to add any frontend testing frameworks.

Back-end
Express
Mongoose - will help backend communicate with MongoDB 

Mongo Express will be used for data administration stuff...
This is mainly for the benefit of the data entry team later on...
