# Problem with Mapbox

Hey Guys so I now understand why the mapbox isnt working. The setup for it is pretty simple, but React complicates it. I can't just integrate it into the webpage because react does not let you excecute javascript from return. If you want to see what it looks like, you can run npm start from cd msp/src/Map.
